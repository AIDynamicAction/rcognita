`rcognita` is a framework for hybrid agent-enviroment simultion.
The hybrid setting here means the actions are updated at discrete moments in time, whereas the environment dynamics are modelled time-continuous.
A detailed documentation is available [here](https://aidynamicaction.github.io/rcognita/).
