`rcognita` is a framework for hybrid agent-enviroment simultion.
The hybrid setting here means the actions are updated at discrete moments in time, whereas the environment dynamics are modelled time-continuous.<br>
A detailed documentation is available at <a href="https://aidynamicaction.github.io/rcognita/">documentation</a>.
