**Rcognita testing framework**

This is a testing framework for pipelines implemented with Rcognita. It can be used for reference data generation and testing from logical (successful building) and numerical (trajectories comparison) points of view.

__How to launch tests__:

If you introduced some changes, this framework is a best sanity check before your commit and pull-request.

To launch tests, from `/tests` (current) directory execute `pytest -v`
